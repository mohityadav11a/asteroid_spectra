# asteroid_spectra
Tools & technologies used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Developed a complete pipeline to fetch, parse, and enrich asteroid spectral datasets for analysis.

Created visualization modules to interactively explore spectral patterns and trends.

Implemented multiple ML models (Binary/Multiclass SVM, Dense Neural Networks, CNNs) to predict asteroid types.

Optimized performance with hyperparameter tuning and compared results across models.
